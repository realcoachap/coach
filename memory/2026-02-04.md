Today I completed significant enhancements to the EliteFit personal training website, specifically the client dashboard. The major accomplishments include:

1. Created the "Ascended Calendar" - an enhanced scheduling system with:
   - Four viewing modes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
   - Event selection modal with "Book a Session" and "Set Availability" options
   - Improved aesthetics with gradients and modern design
   - Responsive layout for all device sizes

2. Added the "XP - Level UP!" feature - a gamification system with:
   - XP tracking and leveling system
   - Achievement badges and progress indicators
   - Activity-based XP earning system
   - Trophy icon and dedicated sidebar navigation

3. Fixed critical bug where clicking "Schedule" was showing old calendar instead of the new Ascended Calendar by modifying the setCalendarView function to properly render weekly view without page reload.

4. Successfully deployed all changes to the main branch of the coach repository at https://github.com/realcoachap/coach for use with GitHub Pages.

The Ascended Calendar replaces the basic calendar with an aesthetically pleasing design inspired by the Gridfiti template while maintaining EliteFit brand identity. The system is now fully functional with proper event handling and UI interactions.
